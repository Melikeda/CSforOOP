# C# Object Oriented Programming & Fundamentals Practice

This repository contains **topic-based C# code examples** created while studying **C# fundamentals and Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
Each `.cs` file focuses on a **single concept** and is written for learning, experimentation, and reinforcement purposes.

## 📚 Topics Covered

The repository includes practical examples covering the following areas:

### 🔹 C# Fundamentals
- Variables and Data Types
- Type Casting (Implicit / Explicit)
- Control Statements (if, if-else, switch-case)
- Loops (for, foreach, while, do-while)
- Methods and Parameters
- Arrays and Collections
- String Operations
- Math and Random Functions
- User Input Handling

### 🔹 Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors and Destructors
- Encapsulation (Get / Set)
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Interfaces
- Abstract Classes and Methods
- Virtual, Override, and Sealed Methods
- Composition
- `this` keyword
- Static Members
- Readonly and Const Variables

### 🔹 Exception Handling
- try-catch blocks
- Custom exception handling
- Common exceptions:
  - DivideByZeroException
  - NullReferenceException
  - IndexOutOfRangeException
  - FileNotFoundException
  - OverflowException
  - FormatException
  - Throwing Exceptions

### 🔹 LINQ
- LINQ basics
- Let clause
- LINQ practice examples

### 🔹 Additional Practice
- Interview-style problems
- Small algorithmic exercises
- Console-based practice programs

## 📂 Project Structure

- Each `.cs` file represents a **single topic or concept**
- File names are intentionally descriptive (e.g. `AbstractMethod.cs`, `Inheritance.cs`)
- All examples are implemented as **console applications**

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

- Build a strong foundation in **C# and OOP**
- Understand core programming concepts through hands-on examples
- Prepare for:
  - Advanced C# topics
  - Software development courses
  - Technical interviews and internships

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- C#
- Console Applications
- Object Oriented Programming Principles
